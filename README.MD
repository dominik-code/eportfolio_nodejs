This repository is for my ePortfolio about node.js

Please download and install node.js and npm from:
https://nodejs.org/de/download/

After the installation execute the command "node -v" in your command prompt.
Now you should see the version of nodejs if the installation was successful.

Please clone or download the zip of this repository.
It will be used after the presentation to show some demos.
